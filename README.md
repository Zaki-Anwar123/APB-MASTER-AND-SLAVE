# APB-MASTER-AND-SLAVE
This project implements an APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) master-slave system in Verilog with support for multiple slaves. The master handles address decoding, data transfer, and error signaling, while each slave manages memory-mapped read/write operations. A comprehensive testbench verifies functionality and protocol compliance.
